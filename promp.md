# Promp

At Arvolution we like Ping Pong, and we believe that a tracking system for games will be a huge success in the office.

Prototype
To validate our vision we will make a prototype.
The wireframe can be found on the following link: https://projects.invisionapp.com/freehand/document/2rTrh4R7y

Your task is to build all the necessary APIs to make this work.

Requirements
   - NodeJS for the backend
   - Any database for storing data
   - At least 4 APIs (Up to you to decide; but adding some examples: Save users, get games, get users, get top performer from the last 5 games, save game)
   - You must use some linter for the code
   - You must use git for version control (at least 2 commits)
   - You must have at least one test
   - You must include a README with instructions on how to run the application
   - When you finish you can send us a zip, tarball, upload it to GitHub or a messenger eagle with a thumb drive. Whatever method you prefer.
   - Everything else is up to you
   - Not required to create a frontend. However if you manage to build a small UI that would be great.

We are hoping to get the test back by next Monday. If you need any additional time please let us know as soon as possible.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

Best regards, David J
